<p><strong>SECTION 2: USERS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This section describes what information is collected by Macro People from Users, and how that information is used by Macro People.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What information we collect from Users</strong></p>
<p>When an account is set up for the User to access and use their SASensai Account, we collect and store certain pieces of Personal Data and other information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full name of the User</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also collect and store the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When and how the User uses the Website, including (but not limited to) activity data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, and the resources and functions of the SASensei Account that the User uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising and other data from different sources, including data from feeds which are integrated into the Website, as well as content and other data which is posted or otherwise provided by Users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Data as part of these activities, but due to the automated nature of the operation of the SASensei Accounts we are unable to prevent the collection of any Personal Data uploaded by Users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where and how we store your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>The information that we collect from you (including any Personal Data) may be transferred to, and stored at, various destinations, but only within the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"). It may also be processed by staff operating at various locations within the EEA who work for us or for one of our hosting, connectivity or telecommunications service providers. By providing us with your information (including Personal Data), you agree to this transfer, storing and processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data (including the use of HTTPS protocol on the web application), we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How we use information collected from Users</strong></p>
<p>We use information collected from Users to provide the functionality of the Website and the SASensei Account in accordance with the Terms of Use. We also use the information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To contact Users to help them with their use of their SASensei Account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To communicate with Users on matters related to the Website or their SASensei Accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help us improve the Website and the SASensei Accounts. Again, Users can not be identified from these activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Updating User information</strong></p>
<p>Users can edit any of their information within their SASensei Account. It is the User&rsquo;s responsibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To protect against unauthorised access to their SASensei Account and the Website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To log-off from their SASensei Account when not using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To keep their log-in details secret.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What we share with third parties</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Data to our third party service providers (including without limitation our email management services provider) to help us provide the SASensei Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Data to any member of our group of companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Data to third parties:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce our contractual rights; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Macro People, our stakeholders, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
