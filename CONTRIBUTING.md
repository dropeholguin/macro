#guidelines

* All commits should reference an issue number

* If deployment process has changed, readme file should be updated

* At least one other person should review (approve) each PR

* All branches should start with respective issue number (or create a branch directly from JIRA)

* Re-base your branch with development before creating a PR

* If you are happy for your PR to be merged, then approve it yourself (else might be assumed that it is just for review)
